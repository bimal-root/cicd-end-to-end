# Docker Networking

Networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with the host system. Containers run isolated from the host system
and need a way to communicate with each other and with the host system.

By default, Docker provides two network drivers for you, the bridge and the overlay drivers. 

```
docker network ls
```

```
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
xxxxxxxxxxxx        none                null
xxxxxxxxxxxx        host                host
xxxxxxxxxxxx        bridge              bridge
```


### Bridge Networking

The default network mode in Docker. It creates a private network between the host and containers, allowing
containers to communicate with each other and with the host system.

If you want to secure your containers and isolate them from the default bridge network you can also create your own bridge network.

```
docker network create -d bridge my_bridge
```

Now, if you list the docker networks, you will see a new network.

```
docker network ls

NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
xxxxxxxxxxxx        bridge              bridge
xxxxxxxxxxxx        my_bridge           bridge
xxxxxxxxxxxx        none                null
xxxxxxxxxxxx        host                host
```

This new network can be attached to the containers, when you run these containers.

```
docker run -d --net=my_bridge --name db training/postgres
```

This way, you can run multiple containers on a single host platform where one container is attached to the default network and 
the other is attached to the my_bridge network.

These containers are completely isolated with their private networks and cannot talk to each other.

However, you can at any point of time, attach the first container to my_bridge network and enable communication

```
docker network connect my_bridge web
```

### Host Networking

This mode allows containers to share the host system's network stack, providing direct access to the host system's network.

### Overlay Networking

This mode enables communication between containers across multiple Docker host machines, allowing containers to be connected to a single network even when they are running on different hosts.

### Macvlan Networking

This mode allows a container to appear on the network as a physical host rather than as a container.
